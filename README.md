# Neural Style Transfer Project
This project is based off of the neural style transfer approach described in [Medium blogpost](https://medium.com/tensorflow/neural-style-transfer-creating-art-with-deep-learning-using-tf-keras-and-eager-execution-7d541ac31398). <br/>

## Setup (for MacOS)
Need Python 3.6 or below. <br/>
It might be useful to use [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and [create a conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). <br/>
In Terminal, navigate to the project folder and activate a Python virtual environment: <br/>
```
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Then, install the required packages with the appropriate versions: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Lastly, run the file: 
```
python3 nstTutorial.py
```
